## FINAL CONCLUSION...
ðŸ“Œ Digital advertising works, but trust and platform choice are critical.
Brands targeting millennials and Gen Z should focus on Instagram, TikTok, and video-based advertising while ensuring credibility to drive conversions.

ðŸ“Œ Mobile-first strategies are essential.
Since most consumers shop via mobile, businesses must optimize mobile-friendly websites, seamless checkout processes, and mobile-targeted advertising.

## FINAL CONCLUSION 

ðŸ“Œ Brand trust is the key to conversion.
While digital ads can attract attention, consumers will only purchase if they trust the brand, so companies should invest in authentic storytelling, customer reviews, and transparency.

ðŸ“Œ Video and influencer marketing dominate.
To maximize ad effectiveness, brands should prioritize short-form video content, sponsored social posts, and influencer collaborations over traditional display ads or email campaigns.

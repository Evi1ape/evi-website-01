I am a motivated and detail-oriented marketing enthusiast with a strong background in management, specializing in entrepreneurship and innovation. Currently pursuing an MSc in Experiential Digital Marketing Communications, I am passionate about combining creativity with strategic thinking to drive impactful marketing campaigns.

With hands-on experience in corporate administration, client relationship management, and strategic product placement, I excel at project coordination, regulatory compliance, and enhancing customer engagement. My professional journey has equipped me with strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills, allowing me to navigate complex business environments effectively.

I am always eager to learn, stay ahead of digital marketing trends, and contribute to innovative marketing strategies. Fluent in Greek and English, with foundational knowledge in Spanish and Italian, I thrive in multicultural settings and collaborative environments.

I am particularly interested in brand storytelling, experiential marketing, and data-driven decision-making to create meaningful consumer experiences.

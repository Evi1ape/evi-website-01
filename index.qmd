About Me & Why Iâ€™m Conducting This Survey

Hi! My name is Evanthia, and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Experiential Digital Marketing Communications. As someone passionate about understanding digital consumer behavior and marketing trends, I am conducting this survey to explore how people interact with digital ads, discover products online, and make purchasing decisions.

Your feedback will provide valuable insights into the role of social media, advertising, and brand trust in shaping consumer choices. The results will help analyze which marketing strategies are the most effective and how brands can enhance their online presence.

Your time and honest responses are greatly appreciatedâ€”thank you for participating! ðŸ˜Š
